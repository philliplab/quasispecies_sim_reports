Hence we need to capture some of the key information about the last generation and figure out ways to compare it to other simulations. Three key ways to look at this data is: The average of all the pairwise distances between the sequences. A density plot of the distribution of all the pairwise distances. The deciles / quartiles / some other set of percentiles of the distribution. For now we will present all three. Once we have some solid results to argue about we can look at dropping some of these metrics. The average pairwise HD is 333.66 and normalized by the length of the sequence it is 0.667. The distribution is shown in Figure 1.1 and the deciles are listed in Table 1.3.

["more-realistic-mu.html", "2 More realistic mu", " 2 More realistic mu Note that the extremely high value of mu (0.1) produces sequences that rapidly diverge radically from the ancestor. To make the simulation a little more realistic, drop the mutation rate down to 1 in 1000 and try again. The average pairwise HD is 9.73 and normalized by the length of the sequence it is 0.019. The distribution is shown in the Figure below and the deciles are listed in the following Table. The last two tables in this section show the arguments used to call sim_pop and a summary of each genealogy.
