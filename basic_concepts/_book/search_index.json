Hence we need to capture some of the key information about the last generation and figure out ways to compare it to other simulations. Three key ways to look at this data is: The average of all the pairwise distances between the sequences. A density plot of the distribution of all the pairwise distances. The deciles / quartiles / some other set of percentiles of the distribution. For now we will present all three. Once we have some solid results to argue about we can look at dropping some of these metrics. The average pairwise HD is 335.21 and normalized by the length of the sequence it is 0.67. The distribution is shown in Figure 1.1 and the deciles are listed in Table 1.3.

["more-realistic-mu.html", "2 More realistic mu", " 2 More realistic mu Note that the extremely high value of mu (0.1) produces sequences that rapidly diverge radically from the ancestor. To make the simulation a little more realistic, drop the mutation rate down to 1 in 1000 and try again. The average pairwise HD is 7.47 and normalized by the length of the sequence it is 0.015. The distribution is shown in the Figure below and the deciles are listed in the following Table.

["small-number-of-simulations.html", "3 Small number of simulations", " 3 Small number of simulations The goal is to compare different simulations to each other. First, we will start with a small number of simulations that we can still pay attention to each individual simulation. Note that here we only consider simulations performed with similar parameters since comparisons based on small number of examples for stochastic processes can be very misleading. The idea is just to expand the chunk that showcases a single simulation by adding in extra density curves and extra rows into the tables. The following tables show some summary metrics for 10 simulations.

["sets-of-different-simulations.html", "4 Sets of different simulations", " 4 Sets of different simulations The true goal is to compare sets of simulations where some parameter was varied to each other. Initially due to computational restraints (upgrades needed to yasss as well as some caching facilities), we will restrict this to comparisons of small numbers of simulations (~30) grouped into 2 to 4 groups. The goal here is to show how the distributions and the metrics diverge between the groups. Four data structures are used to track all this: the all_sim_results data.frame - see the few_sim_chunk the group_membership data.frame: sim_id, group_id, group_label and group description arg_sets: A list indexed by group_id. Each element is a list with three elements: group_label: The label used to describe the group group_desc: The full description of the group args: The list of arguments used with do.call to run sim_pop "]
