Hence we need to capture some of the key information about the last generation and figure out ways to compare it to other simulations. Three key ways to look at this data is: The average of all the pairwise distances between the sequences. A density plot of the distribution of all the pairwise distances. The deciles / quartiles / some other set of percentiles of the distribution. For now we will present all three. Once we have some solid results to argue about we can look at dropping some of these metrics. The average pairwise HD is 333.11 and normalized by the length of the sequence it is 0.666. The distribution is shown in Figure 1.1 and the deciles are listed in Table 1.3.

To make the simulation a little more realistic, drop the mutation rate down to 1 in 1000 and try again. Table 2.1: Configuration with which sim_pop was called.
